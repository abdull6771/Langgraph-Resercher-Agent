# AI-Powered Research Assistant

Hereâ€™s a basic project starter template for your AI-Powered Research Assistant using LangGraph. This setup includes a multi-agent system with a Planner Agent, Retriever Agent, Critic Agent, and Writer Agent. The framework is designed for expansion, allowing you to integrate additional capabilities later.

## Project Breakdown

### ðŸ”¹ Agents:
- **Planner**: Breaks down the research query into structured objectives.

- **Critic**: Analyzes credibility and biases in sources.
- **Writer**: Summarizes findings into a structured research report.

### ðŸ”¹ Workflow Execution:
- Uses LangGraph to define the agent workflow.

## Features
- **Multi-Agent System**: A structured approach to research assistance.
- **Gradio UI**: A user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- **Expandable Framework**: Allows for future enhancements and new agents.
