# AI Code Review Agent

This project implements an AI-powered code review agent using Gradio and LangGraph. The agent takes a user query as input, processes it using an AI model, and returns a structured review.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Code Review**: Uses an intelligent agent to analyze and provide structured feedback on user queries.
- **Gradio UI**: A user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- **Quick Deployment**: Easily deploy the interface with a shareable public URL.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd Langgraph-Resercher-Agent
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the Gradio application:
```bash
python app.py
